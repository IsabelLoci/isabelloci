My name is Isabel, I am a computer science major studying at the College of Staten Island. Three years ago, I traveled from Albania to the United States excited to start a brand new chapter of my life, and today I am in my senior year and soon to graduate. How fast time passes!

Here are some things I am passionate about:
- Mario games, rhythm games, indie RPGs, Minecraft
- Learning fun bits of information about anything and everything
- Bright colors, funky patterns, upbeat music
- My pet parrot Bingo
